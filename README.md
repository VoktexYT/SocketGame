# Socket game

## Multiplayer Fireball Dodger Game
This is a personal multiplayer game project I am developing. The main objective of the game is for players to dodge fireballs.

## Technology Stack
The game is built using the following core technologies:

Pygame: Used for displaying the video game and handling graphics.

Socket: Used for client-server communication over a specific port.

Threading: Used to divide the workload within the code, allowing the server to handle each connected player concurrently.

## Future Updates
I plan to implement the following features in upcoming updates:
Room System: Create a system to manage separate game rooms where multiple players can connect.
Public Deployment: Make the game publicly accessible on the internet, allowing users outside the local network to connect and play.
