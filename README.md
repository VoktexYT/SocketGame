# Socket game

This is the multiplayer game.
Make by me.
I use pygame, socket and threading.
The but is to dodge the fireball.

Pygame: for display the video game.
Socket: for call server whit port.
Threads: to divide the work in the code of each player

The futur update ?

Create the room system for connect some player
Put the video game on public (to connect to internet)

Etc
